      <h2>üìú Background Story</h2>
      <p>
        Computer engineering has been relevant since I was little. It was quite a journey for me as my parents have near
        to zero experience with computer which left me learning a lot about it by myself at an early age. Though my
        parents were
        quite supportive about it, as they let me took private course of Photoshop editing at middle school.
      </p>
      Learning new stuff on the internet and playing around with it have been something that I enjoy. From learning how
      to hack computer games,
      editing, and some other simple software skills, to programming softwares and websites.
      <p>
        I have decided to have an IT-degree since middle school and here I am, studying and pursuing my dream in Germany
        as a IT-student.
        I've learnt a lot about coding and software programming since I started college. But as any other developer
        would say, we won't
        stop learning as long as the earth spins. And that I'll do..

          <h3>Kuchen Automat</h3>
          <p>A java program created solo as a university project on 2021. This software is created for the purpose of
            maintain/ administer
            a cake machine. It has the ability to manipulate cakes (CRUD) and at the same time automaticaly update the
            software GUI.
            Here I learned important aspects of a software such as unit tests, layer distribution, encapsulation,
            command line intefaces,
            thread safety, simple GUI, events, observers, and persistency.

          <h3><br>Portfolio</h3>
          <p>This portfolio is created using Three.js and with the purpose of listing all of my projects that I
            made/ contributed to. Here I took the first step towards 3 dimensional website programming and animation.
            Things that I learned includes camera, renderer, scene and css styling with animation. All credits to
            Fireship for teaching how to make 3d portfolio. Link to his youtube on github link below.

          <h2>03</h2>
          <h3>PackDieBade<br>HoseEin</h3>
          <p>My first mobile iOS Application created with swift. The main purpose is to list all of the registered lake
            in Berlin and shows
            their names, coordinates, and exact location by using google map. The application has the ability to read
            JSON file and convert it
            into data. Here I learned about JSON File format and how to send and receive information to/from it. Another
            important lesson is
            how to build iOS simple GUI and how to add persistent items such as 'add to favorites'.
