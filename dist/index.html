      <h2>üìú Background Story</h2>
      <p>
        Computer engineering has been relevant since I was little. It was quite a journey for me as my parents have near
        to zero experience with computer which left me learning a lot about it by myself at an early age. Though my
        parents were
        quite supportive about it, as they let me took private course of Photoshop editing at middle school.
      </p>
      Learning new stuff on the internet and playing around with it have been something that I enjoy. From learning how
      to hack computer games,
      editing, and some other simple software skills, to programming softwares and websites.
      <p>
        I have decided to have an IT-degree since middle school and here I am, studying and pursuing my dream in Germany
        as a IT-student.
        I've learnt a lot about coding and software programming since I started college. But as any other developer
        would say, we won't
        stop learning as long as the earth spins. And that I'll do..

          <h3>Kuchen Automat</h3>
          <p>A java program created solo as a university project on 2021. This software is created for the purpose of
            maintain/ administer
            a cake machine. It has the ability to manipulate cakes (CRUD) and at the same time automaticaly update the
            software GUI.
            Here I learned important aspects of a software such as unit tests, layer distribution, encapsulation,
            command line intefaces,
            thread safety, simple GUI, events, observers, and persistency.

          <h3>Portfolio (This website)</h3>
          <p>This portfolio is created using Three.js and with the purpose of listing all of my projects that I
            made/ contributed to. Here I took the first step towards 3 dimensional website programming and animation.
            Things that I learned includes camera, renderer, scene and css styling with animation. All credits to
            Fireship for teaching how to make 3d portfolio. Link to his youtube on github link below.
